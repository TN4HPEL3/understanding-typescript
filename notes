The key differences is: JavaScript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), TypeScript uses "static types" (set during development)

Type Casing:

- In TypeScript, you work with types like string or number all the times.
- Important: It is string and number (etc.), NOT String, Number etc.
- The core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase.

1. Why are "Types" usefull and offer an advantage compare to vanilla JavaScript?

- Types allow you to detect errors early and avoid runtimes errors.

2. Assigning a boolean to a variable which was assigned a "string" types is not allowed and will yield a compilation error.

3. What's the difference between JavaScript types and TypeScript types?

- TS are checked during compilation, JS types during runtime.
