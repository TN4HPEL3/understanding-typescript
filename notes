The key differences is: JavaScript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), TypeScript uses "static types" (set during development)

Type Casing:
  - In TypeScript, you work with types like string or number all the times.
  - Important: It is string and number (etc.), NOT String, Number etc.
  - The core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase.
